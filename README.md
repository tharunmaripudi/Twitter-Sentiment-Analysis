# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Twitter is a popular social networking website where users post and interact with message known 
as “tweets”. This serves as a mean for individuals to express their thoughts or feelings about
different subjects. 
Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing 
the opinion of the crowd.
Extraction of sentiments can be done by a rule based approach under 
Natural Language Processing which uses “TextBlob” that also gives significance of the tweet. 
The proposed method (LR-LSTM) is to use a stacked ensemble of two LSTM as embedding layers 
and Logistic Regression (LR) as output layer which is effective and time saving. 
If the tweet has both positive 
and negative elements, the more dominant sentiment should be taken as the final label.
